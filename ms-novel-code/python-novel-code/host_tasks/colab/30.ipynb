        "\n",
        "1) **What is the initial use case?**\n",
        "The initial problem involves ants moving along a plank of lengthâ€¯*n* at unit speed. They reverse direction instantly upon meeting another ant and fall off immediately upon reaching either end of the plank. Given the starting positions of left-moving and right-moving ants, the task is to determine the time at which the last ant falls off the plank.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Why is the initial use case easy?**\n",
        "The initial problem is easy because the collision rules simplify the interactions between ants. Since ants reverse direction upon meeting but continue moving at the same speed, their paths can be treated independently. This reduces the problem to finding the longest time it takes for any ant to reach an end of the plank, which is straightforward to compute.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **How could we make it harder?**\n",
        "To increase the complexity, we can:\n",
        "- **Hint 1**: Transform the plank into a network of interconnected paths (a graph or tree), requiring advanced graph algorithms or dynamic programming to analyze ant movements.\n",
        "- **Hint 2**: Introduce varying ant speeds and masses, affecting collision outcomes and necessitating efficient tracking of positions and interactions using advanced data structures.\n",
        "- **Hint 5**: Allow ants to form and break groups upon collisions, impacting their speed or direction collectively, and use union-find data structures to manage group dynamics.\n",
        "These additions create complex interactions and dependencies that require multi-step reasoning and advanced algorithmic approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Which parameters can we change?**\n",
        "- **Structure**: Change the simple plank into a tree-shaped network, introducing multiple paths and nodes.\n",
        "- **Ant Properties**: Assign varying speeds and masses to ants, affecting how they move and interact.\n",
        "- **Collision Rules**: When ants meet, they form groups, combine masses, and adjust their speeds based on the total mass.\n",
        "- **Edge Dynamics**: Edges (paths) expand or contract based on the ant load, affecting movement speeds and requiring dynamic computation of travel times.\n",
        "These changes introduce non-obvious subproblems, logical traps, and require careful tracking of multiple interacting constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) **What can be a final hard prompt?**\n",
        "The final complex question incorporates these parameters, challenging the solver to consider the dynamic nature of the ants' movements, group formations, and path transformations to determine the minimal total time for all ants to exit the network."
