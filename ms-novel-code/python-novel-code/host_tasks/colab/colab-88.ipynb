        "Design and implement a simple, scalable, multi-threaded TCP server in Python. The server listens on a configurable host and port. When a client connects, it spawns a new thread to handle that connection. Each client thread reads UTF-8 lines terminated by newline, processes each line, and sends back a response line. If a client sends “shutdown” the server should close only that client’s connection. If any client sends “quit\\_server” the server should stop accepting new connections, wait for all active threads to finish, then exit cleanly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input Format and Constraints\n",
        "Clients connect via TCP and send UTF-8 text messages, one per line, ending with `\\n`.\n",
        "Each message is either:\n",
        "\n",
        "* an arbitrary text line to be echoed back prefixed with `ACK: `\n",
        "* the literal line `shutdown`\n",
        "* the literal line `quit_server`\n",

        "You may assume clients always send well-formed UTF-8 lines. There is no need to validate message syntax beyond detecting these keywords.\n",

        "# Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "# Explicit and Implicit Points\n",
        "• Use only the Python standard library modules `socket` and `threading`\n",
        "• Accept and handle each client in its own `Thread`\n",
        "• Read and write UTF-8 lines terminated by newline\n",
        "• Detect `shutdown` and `quit_server` commands exactly as specified\n",
        "• Ensure the main accept loop runs independently of client threads\n",
        "• Use a thread-safe flag or event to coordinate full server shutdown\n",
        "\n",
        "# Solution Expectations\n",
        "• A function `start_server(host: str, port: int) -> None` that starts the server and blocks until shutdown\n",
        "• Per-connection logic encapsulated in a `ClientHandler` class (subclass of `threading.Thread` or similar)\n",
        "• When `quit_server` arrives, no new clients are accepted and the server waits for all client threads to finish before exiting\n",
        "• Socket errors or client disconnects must be caught and logged per client without crashing the server\n",
        "\n",
        "# Signatures of Expected Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "def start_server(host: str, port: int) -> None\n",

        "# Relevant Classes or Structures\n",
        "ClientHandler\n",
        "• public fields: `conn`, `addr`, `shutdown_event`\n",
        "• public methods: `__init__`, `run`\n",
        "\n",
        "# Edge Case Behavior\n",
        "• Empty input lines-> treat as normal text and reply `ACK: \\n`\n",
        "• Client disconnects mid-line or sends invalid UTF-8-> catch exception, log it, close that client only\n",
        "• Multiple clients send `quit_server` concurrently-> only the first triggers shutdown, subsequent ones are ignored because the server is already stopping\n",
        "\n",
        "# Constraints\n",
        "• No external dependencies beyond `socket`, `threading`, `logging`, and other standard modules\n",
        "• Follow PEP 8 naming and layout\n",
        "• No global mutable state except a thread-safe shutdown flag or `Event`\n",
        "• The server must handle at least dozens of concurrent clients without code changes\n",
        "\n",
        "# Important Notes\n",
        "• You can assume the input lines satisfy the format; no extra validation is required\n",
        "• On detecting invalid data or socket errors per client, simply log and close that client socket\n",
        "• Keep the prompt and requirements clear to enable straightforward automated testing of each behavior"
