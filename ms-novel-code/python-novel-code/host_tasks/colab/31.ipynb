        "5. An interval is valid for inclusion only if all of its dependencies have been satisfied.\n",
        "6. Dependencies form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). No cycles will be present.\n",
        "7. Intervals are non-overlapping per student, but may overlap across students.\n",

        "1. Efficient dependency evaluation is needed, so consider topological sorting to determine the order of interval unlocks.\n",
        "2. You may preprocess intervals to resolve dependency chains before answering queries.\n",
