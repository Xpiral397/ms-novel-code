The system should be able to add tasks to the queue, process tasks from the queue, and gracefully shut down by draining the queue before termination. The queue processing system should be designed in such a way that it does not lose any tasks during shutdown. The shutdown process should involve stopping the addition of new tasks to the queue, processing all remaining tasks in the queue, and then terminating the system. The system should be able to handle any exceptions during task processing, ensuring that it does not crash unexpectedly.\n",

        "- The system must support adding tasks, processing tasks, and graceful shutdown.\n",

        "- The system must not crash or lose tasks during execution or shutdown.\n",

        "Implicit Requirements:\n",
        "- The system should run in a separate thread for background processing.\n",
        "- Task processing should be asynchronous from task submission.\n",
        "- The shutdown process should be thread-safe and idempotent.\n",
        "- The system should support multiple tasks being added before and during processing.\n",
        "- The queue size can be unbounded unless explicitly modified later.\n",
        "- The system must maintain internal state (e.g., is_shutting_down flag) to control behavior.\n",
        "- Logging or print statements may be used for debugging and tracking task outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution Expectations:\n",
        "- Define a class (e.g., QueueProcessor) to encapsulate queue operations, threading, and shutdown logic.\n",
        "- Use Python's queue.Queue for managing task storage and retrieval.\n",

        "- Provide a method to add tasks only when the system is not shutting down.\n",
        "- Ensure tasks are executed safely with exception handling to prevent crashes.\n",
        "- Implement a shutdown method that:\n",
        "  - Stops acceptance of new tasks,\n",
        "  - Waits until the queue is empty,\n",
        "  - Joins the worker thread to ensure clean termination.\n",
        "- Print output for each successfully completed task.\n",
        "- Print error details when exceptions occur during task execution.\n",

        "  - The system should raise a clear exception or ignore the task safely.\n",

        "  - The exception must be caught and printed; processing must continue for other tasks.\n",
        "- No tasks are added before shutdown:\n",
        "  - The system should shut down cleanly without processing anything.\n",
        "- A long-running task is being processed during shutdown:\n",
        "  - The system must wait for the task to complete before termination.\n",
        "- Multiple tasks added in rapid succession:\n",
