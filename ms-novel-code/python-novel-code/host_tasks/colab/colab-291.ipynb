        "\n",
        "## Problem Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "You are tasked with designing a standalone Python module that simulates Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection as it would be integrated into a Flask-style web application. The module must include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A mock request abstraction capable of representing incoming HTTP requests with headers, cookies, form data, query parameters, session-like storage, and method (GET, POST, etc.).\n",
        "* A CSRF token manager responsible for securely generating, storing (simulated), embedding, and validating CSRF tokens.\n",
        "* Middleware-like logic that can be applied to mock requests to enforce CSRF protection according to best practices, with support for customizable token lifetimes, per-session binding, and double-submit cookie patterns.\n",
        "* Facilities to simulate attack scenarios (e.g., missing token, forged token, token reuse, expired token, cross-origin form submissions) and validate that the protection logic detects and rejects invalid requests while allowing legitimate ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem is intended to surface subtle edge cases in CSRF protection and requires implementing both the protective mechanisms and the verification logic in a way that would make the module easily pluggable into a real Flask application (for example, by swapping the mock request for a real request wrapper).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Input Format\n",
        "\n",
        "The module will primarily be driven via function/class method calls. Inputs consist of:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. MockRequest instances which include:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * method: HTTP method string (e.g., \"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\").\n",
        "   * headers: dictionary of HTTP headers.\n",
        "   * cookies: dictionary of cookie names to values.\n",
        "   * form: dictionary representing form submission payload.\n",
        "   * query: dictionary representing URL query parameters.\n",
        "   * session: dictionary representing per-session storage (to simulate server-side session).\n",
        "   * origin: value of the Origin header (could be None).\n",
        "   * referer: value of the Referer header (could be None).\n",
        "   * remote_host: the host from which the request is claimed to originate.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Configuration parameters to the CSRF protection manager, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * secret_key: secret material used in token generation.\n",
        "   * token_lifetime_seconds: how long a generated token is valid.\n",
        "   * token_storage_strategy: e.g., per-session, stateless HMAC, double-submit cookie.\n",
        "   * list of safe methods that should skip CSRF validation (e.g., GET, HEAD, OPTIONS).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Invocation of validation logic should supply:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The incoming MockRequest.\n",
        "   * Optional explicit CSRF token to validate (e.g., extracted from form or header).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Output Format\n",
        "\n",
        "The module should expose functions/classes that return structured results and raise exceptions for failures. Outputs include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. On token generation: a token string, and an associated metadata object (e.g., expiration timestamp, binding info).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. On validation:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * A boolean/pass-fail indication.\n",
        "   * If invalid, a rich error object or exception detailing the failure reason (e.g., missing token, mismatch, expired, origin mismatch, reused, double-submit violation).\n",
        "   * If valid, optionally a refreshed token or confirmation that the existing token remains valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Utility outputs for diagnostics/test harness:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Attack detection logs indicating why a request was flagged.\n",
        "   * Replay detection state.\n",
        "\n",

        "# Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "## Explicit Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define a `MockRequest` class (or equivalent) that encapsulates all aspects of an HTTP request needed for CSRF logic: method, headers, cookies, form data, query params, session store, origin, referer, and remote host.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Implement a `CsrfProtector` class (or set of functions) with the following core capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Token generation:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Tokens must be cryptographically secure, unguessable, and bound according to strategy (per-session, stateless HMAC with embedded timestamp, or double-submit).\n",
        "     * Support embedding token metadata (e.g., creation time, expiration) without exposing internal secrets on the client in insecure ways.\n",
        "   * Token validation:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Validate presence and correctness of token according to chosen strategy.\n",
        "     * Check for expiration.\n",
        "     * Detect token reuse if the strategy demands single-use or rotation.\n",
        "     * Ensure binding (e.g., session binding or origin consistency) is enforced if configured.\n",
        "   * Support for safe HTTP methods that bypass validation.\n",
        "   * Support for the double-submit cookie pattern as an alternative to server-side token storage.\n",
        "   * Configurable token lifetime and secret material.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Provide clear, enumerated failure reasons for rejection that can be programmatically inspected. Examples: \"token missing\", \"token mismatch\", \"token expired\", \"origin mismatch\", \"replay detected\", \"method not allowed\", \"double-submit mismatch\".\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Design the interface such that the module can:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Be tested in isolation (i.e., no real Flask dependency).\n",
        "   * Be integrated into a Flask application by mapping Flask's `request` object to the module's `MockRequest` abstraction with minimal glue.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Include a mechanism (in-memory) to simulate and detect replay attacks, respecting token lifetime and optionally per-request nonce/usage tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Implement safe defaults: if no explicit configuration is passed, use per-session token binding, 5-minute lifetime, and reject unsafe methods without valid tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Provide a way to retrieve or regenerate a rotated token in a secure manner (token rotation policy) without opening a window for replay unless explicitly allowed.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implicit Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The module must not expose secret keys or internal HMAC keys in any client-visible token in a way that allows forgery; if stateless tokens are used, they must be authenticated (e.g., HMAC) and include expiry to prevent tampering.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The design must minimize race conditions in token rotation and detection of reuse (simulate multi-step requests where a rotated token is used concurrently).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Error reporting must be structured (not just strings); for example, use exception subclasses or error codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The module should be extensible: future strategies (e.g., origin-bound encrypted tokens, double-submit with additional entropy) should be addable without rewriting core validation logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. All time comparisons must be timezone-agnostic and use a consistent internal representation (e.g., UTC timestamps).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Token comparison must use constant-time comparison functions to prevent timing attacks in validation logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The module must include self-documenting docstrings on public API surfaces to aid integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function Signature(s) and/or Class Definition(s)\n",
        "\n",
        "Provide at least the following signatures (names may be adapted but behavior must match):\n",

        "\n",
        "## Edge Cases\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Requests using safe methods (e.g., GET) containing a CSRF token: ensure they are allowed even if the token is missing, but optionally log the token if present.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Requests where the token is present in both form and header/cookie with conflicting values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Expired tokens used within a narrow window during token rotation (e.g., user submits with just-expired token while a new one was issued concurrently).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Replay of a previously valid token when replay detection is enabled versus disabled.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Cross-origin form submission where the origin header is missing, present but mismatch, or deliberately manipulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Token generation and immediate validation (zero delay) versus delayed validation beyond lifetime.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Double-submit cookie where the cookie is present but the form token is missing, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Stateless token tampering: token with modified payload but correct format should be rejected due to signature mismatch.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Session fixation simulation: token bound to one session being reused with another session identifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Interleaved concurrent requests attempting to use the same token under rotation policy (simulate race conditions).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "1. No external dependencies beyond Python standard library (i.e., do not rely on Flask, cryptography libraries outside hashlib/hmac/secrets, etc.). Use `hmac`, `hashlib`, `secrets`, and `time`/`datetime` from standard library.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Token length must be sufficiently large to prevent brute-force guessing (e.g., using at least 128 bits of entropy where applicable).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. All public methods must complete in amortized constant time with respect to token size and session size (i.e., avoid linear scans of unbounded structures during validation).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The module must be deterministic in behavior for a given seed of the secret key and request state, except where cryptographic randomness is intentionally introduced (token generation).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Memory footprint for replay tracking must be bounded: stale entries beyond token lifetime must be automatically expired or purgeable.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The module must not perform any network I/O; it is purely in-memory and simulation-oriented.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The API should allow injection or mocking of the current time to facilitate deterministic testing (e.g., for expiry and rotation).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Comparisons of tokens for equality must use constant-time comparison (e.g., `hmac.compare_digest`).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. All configuration inputs should be validated at initialization, raising clear errors on invalid values (e.g., unsupported strategy, non-positive lifetime).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. The module must support being imported and used in a test harness without requiring global mutable state outside of instances."
