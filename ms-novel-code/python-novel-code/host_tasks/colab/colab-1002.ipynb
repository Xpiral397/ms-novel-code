        "# Requirements\n",
        "Explicit Requirements:\n",
        "- Each event must be uniquely identified using its `event_id`.\n",
        "- Duplicate events (same `event_id`) must not be processed more than once.\n",
        "- All processed `event_id`s must be persisted in a local file for future deduplication.\n",
        "- The system must log whether an event is processed or skipped due to duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit Requirements:\n",
        "- The solution must be idempotent across multiple runs by persisting state (via a file).\n",
        "- The solution should gracefully handle cases where the storage file does not exist initially.\n",
        "- The system should efficiently handle large input (up to 10,000 events) without reprocessing.\n",
        "- Event ordering should be preserved in output (processed/skipped logs appear in input order).\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution Expectations:\n",
        "- Read and parse the input list of webhook event dictionaries.\n",
        "- Check if each `event_id` has already been processed by referencing a local file.\n",
        "- If the `event_id` is new:\n",
        "  - Process the event (e.g., print or simulate processing).\n",
        "  - Append the `event_id` to the storage file to mark it as processed.\n",
        "  - Print: \"Processed event: <event_id>\"\n",
        "- If the `event_id` already exists in the file:\n",
        "  - Skip processing.\n",
        "  - Print: \"Duplicate event skipped: <event_id>\"\n",
        "- Ensure file read/write operations are safe and efficient.\n",
        "- Maintain a consistent and readable output format.\n",
        "- Perform input validation on all Inputs according to the Input Constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Edge Cases and Behavior:\n",
        "- Duplicate Events in the Same Input:\n",
        "  - Behavior: Only the first occurrence is processed; subsequent duplicates are skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Duplicate Events Across Multiple Runs:\n",
        "  - Behavior: Events processed in previous runs (stored in the file) are not reprocessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Missing or Corrupted Storage File:\n",
        "  - Behavior: If the storage file does not exist, it is created. If it is empty or unreadable, processing continues from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Empty Input List:\n",
        "  - Behavior: No output is printed, and no changes are made to the storage file.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Malformed Events (e.g., missing `event_id`):\n",
        "  - Behavior: Such events should be skipped or raise a descriptive error depending on implementation preference.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Large Volume of Events (e.g., 10,000+):\n",
        "  - Behavior: Must be handled efficiently without memory or performance issues. Deduplication should remain accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Non-UTF8 Characters or Special Characters in `event_id`:\n",
        "  - Behavior: Properly handled as long as the file supports UTF-8 encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reordered Events:\n",
        "  - Behavior: Deduplication is based on `event_id`, so order doesn’t affect correctness but may affect output sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution Constraints:\n",
        "- Must use only standard Python libraries (no external dependencies).\n",
        "- Must support persistent deduplication across multiple script executions via a local file.\n",
        "- Must handle up to 10,000 events per run efficiently.\n",
        "- File I/O operations must be safe, using append or atomic write techniques to avoid corruption.\n",
        "- Must not modify the original input data.\n",
        "- Logging/output must preserve the input event order.\n",
        "- If the storage file is locked or cannot be written to, the system should fail gracefully with an informative error message."
