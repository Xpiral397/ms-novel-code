        "- The scheduler must run continuously in a loop.\n",
        "- Each task has an interval (in seconds) that determines its execution frequency.\n",
        "- Each task has a priority (integer) used to resolve conflicts when tasks overlap.\n",

        "- Tasks are simple Python functions that print messages to the console.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit Requirements:\n",
        "- Lower interval values mean higher frequency of execution.\n",
        "- Tasks with the same priority and interval may be executed in insertion order.\n",
        "- No two tasks should run simultaneously if they conflict in schedule; they should execute sequentially based on priority.\n",
        "- The task list should be user-defined before the scheduler starts and remains static during execution.\n",
        "- The system time is assumed to be simulated or based on time.time() internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution Expectations:\n",
        "- Implement a loop that continuously checks the current time to determine which tasks should run.\n",
        "- Maintain a schedule of tasks, each defined by a function, execution interval, and priority.\n",
        "- Correctly calculate the next run time for each task based on its interval.\n",
        "- When multiple tasks are due at the same time, execute the one with the highest priority.\n",
        "- Ensure that each executed task prints its message to the console as defined.\n",
        "- Handle timing accurately without excessive CPU usage (e.g., use time.sleep).\n",
        "- Ensure the scheduler does not crash unexpectedly due to unhandled exceptions in tasks.\n",
        "- Design should be modular: separate task definition, scheduling, and execution logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Edge Cases and Behavior:\n",
        "- If two or more tasks are scheduled at the exact same time:\n",
        " - Execute the task with the highest priority (higher number = higher priority).\n",
        " - If priorities are equal, execute in the order they were added.\n",
        "- If a task has a zero or negative interval:\n",
        " - Skip or raise an error during validation (invalid configuration).\n",
        "- If a task raises an exception during execution:\n",
        " - Catch and log the exception, continue running other tasks.\n",
        "- If the system clock changes (e.g., jumps backward/forward):\n",
        " - Scheduler may misalign; optionally log a warning or recalculate all next run times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution Constraints:\n",
        "- Must not use the system's native cron scheduler or external schedulers.\n",
        "- Task checking and execution must run in a continuous loop.\n",
        "- Must prioritize and handle task collisions based on priority values.\n",
        "- Task execution should not block the scheduler loop indefinitely.\n",
        "- Task functions must be simple callables (no threads, subprocesses, or async required).\n",
        "- Must enforce uniqueness of task names.\n",
        "- Must validate that the task function is callable.\n",
        "- Must enforce task cap at 100."
