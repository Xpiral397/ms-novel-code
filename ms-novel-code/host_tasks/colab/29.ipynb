        "1) **What is the initial use case?**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The initial problem involves a one-dimensional garden [0, n] with taps at positions 0 through n. Each tap waters an interval based on its range, and we need to find the minimum number of taps to cover the entire garden.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Why is the initial use case easy?**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It reduces to a classic interval coverage problem solvable with a greedy algorithm.\n",
        "   - The problem is one-dimensional with straightforward intervals.\n",
        "   - No advanced data structures or algorithms are required.\n",
        "   - There are no intricate constraints or interactions between taps.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **How could we make it harder?**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Hint 2 (Extend to two dimensions):** By turning the garden into a two-dimensional grid, coverage becomes a computational geometry problem involving areas instead of intervals.\n",
        "   - **Hint 5 (Interactions between taps):** Introducing interactions where activating a tap alters the ranges of neighboring taps adds complexity, requiring state tracking and possibly dynamic programming on graphs.\n",
        "   - **Hint 3 (Capacity constraints):** Adding capacity constraints to taps turns the problem into an optimization task, potentially involving Min-Cost Max-Flow algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Combining these hints significantly increases complexity by:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Requiring the handling of geometric shapes (circles) for coverage.\n",
        "   - Introducing dependencies between taps due to range reductions.\n",
        "   - Incorporating capacity limits that constrain the solution space.\n",
        "   - Necessitating advanced algorithms and data structures to efficiently compute the solution.\n",

        "4) **Which parameters can we change?**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Garden Representation:** Change from a one-dimensional interval to a two-dimensional n × n grid.\n",
        "   - **Tap Coverage:** Instead of intervals, taps water circular areas with varying radii.\n",
        "   - **Tap Interactions:** Activating a tap affects the ranges of neighboring taps, introducing dependencies.\n",
        "   - **Capacity Constraints:** Each tap has a limit on the total area it can water.\n",
        "   - **Objective Function:** Shift from minimizing the number of taps to minimizing total water usage while ensuring full coverage.\n",
        "   - **Constraints:** Introduce pressure loss or other diminishing effects when taps are activated, adding non-linear constraints.\n",
        "   - **Complex Mechanics:** Require algorithms that handle computational geometry, graph theory, and optimization under dynamic conditions.\n",

        "   \"In a two-dimensional garden represented by an n × n grid, there are m taps located at various grid points. Each tap i can water a circular area with radius rᵢ. Activating a tap reduces the radius of its adjacent taps (up, down, left, right) by d units due to pressure loss (but not below zero). Each tap has a limited capacity cᵢ, restricting the total area it can water. Determine the minimum total water usage required to fully water the entire garden, or return -1 if it is impossible.\""
