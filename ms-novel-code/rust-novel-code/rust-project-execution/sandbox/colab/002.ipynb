        "**Use Case** - In a magic card game, there are s kinds of cards like fire water or earth. Each kind has cards with numbers from 1 to n. Every number and kind has four of the same card. To win the game you must make a deck with 3 times t plus 2 cards. The deck must have t sets of 3 cards and one pair of 2 cards. A set of 3 cards can be a run of numbers like 4 5 6 with the same kind or 3 of the exact same card. A pair is 2 of the same card. We only count each group of cards once even if they can be arranged in more than one way. Let d be the number of different decks you can build. We are told d for small numbers like d of 4 1 1 is 20. You are asked to find d of 100000000 100000000 30 and give the answer after dividing by 1000000007 and taking the remainder.\n",
